2. Motivation 

During their professional lives, some of them, for some reason, do not stay in the area of their graduation. Entering a profession that makes it possible to work without a degree in the field is a choice for many. The area of technology, especially programming, is often found in this branch of professions, and many people have doubts as to whether it is really necessary to have a diploma in order to get a job. For analyze this question I formuled those three questions:

What is and how many people work with professional post that graduated in some other are?

Which country there is more professional?

Which post these professionals occupied?

To get conclusion if change for a technology area it is good option.


3. File Descripiton 

Stack Overflow conducts an annual survey of several people around the world. This research is available on its own website, for download where there are some files. In this analysis two csv files were used, schema where it shows the questions asked and the result file. The results are displayed in some columns with the answer of each participant for each question that was asked. In my analysis I chose to use the UndergradMajor, MainBranch and Country columns. In order to use these columns properly, it was necessary to clear the data, perform some filters in relation to work, in addition to separating multiple choice responses into single answers. The analysis it was made in three notebooks each one show the code to respose each question.
